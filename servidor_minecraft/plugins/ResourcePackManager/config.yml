# Automatically host the resource pack on MagmaGuy's servers
# These servers cost money to keep running. There is no guarantee this will be an option forever.
autoHost: true
# Sets whether the resource pack use will be forced to clients
forceResourcePack: false
# Sets whether the resource pack use will be forced to clients
resourcePackPrompt: Use recommended resource pack?
# OPTIONAL: Copy the merged directory to a custom directory location. Useful for unusual setups, like people trying to host with a different plugin.
# If you are hosting with a different plugin make sure to disable Auto-hosting here!
# This will use the plugin directory as the base directory.
# As an example, if you wanted to target ResourcePackManager's output folder, you'd do:
# ResourcePackManage/output
# If you don't know what any of what is written here means, just don't touch this setting!
